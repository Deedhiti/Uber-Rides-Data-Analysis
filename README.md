This Data Analysis project is constructed to gain insights into Uber ride patterns using Python. The key objectives include:
1. UNDERSTANDING RIDE DATA:
   * Analyzing the dataset structure, identifying missing values and cleaning the data.
   * Converting the date-time columns and categorzing them into different periods of the day.
2. DATA PREPROCESSING:
   * Handling missing values in the dataset specially in the PURPOSE column.
   * Splitting date-time into separate columns for better analysis.
   * Removing duplicates from the dataset.
3. DATA VISUALIZATION:
   * Identifying the trends in the ride categories i.e., business or personal.
   * Understanding the peak hours when rides are booked and the popular ride purposes.
   * Exploring correlations beyween different features with the help of 'heatmap'.
   * Analyzing the weekly and monthly ride trends.
4. DISTANCE ANALYSIS:
   * Studying the ride distances using box and distribution plots.
   * Identifying the most common ride distances.
5. INSIGHTS:
   * The most dominant ride is Business-related rides.
   * Most trips occur in the afternnon between 10AM to 5PM.
   * Uber Rides are less frequent in winter months i.e., Nov-Jan
   * Majority of the rides covers a distance of 0-20 miles.
Thus, this analysis helps us in understanding user behavior, optimizing Uber's services and identifying demand trends based on different factors like time, purpose, and distance.

The analysis was done using Python and it following libraries:
i) Pandas: This library helps to load the data frame in a 2D array format and has multiple functions to perform analysis tasks in one go.
ii) Numpy: Numpy arrays are very fast and can perform large computations in a very short time.
iii) Matplotlib / Seaborn: This library is used to draw visualizations.
